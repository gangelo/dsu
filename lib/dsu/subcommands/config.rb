        NAME

        `dsu config init` -- will create and initialize a .dsu file ("#{Dsu::Support::FolderLocations.root_folder}/.dsu") that you may edit. Otherwise, the default configuration will be used.

        SYNOPSIS

        dsu config init

        CONFIGURATION FILE OPTIONS

        The following configuration file options are available:

        editor:

        The default editor to use when editing entry groups if the EDITOR environment variable on your system is not set. The default is 'nano'. You'll need to change the default editor on Windows systems.

        entries_display_order:

        The order by which entries will be displayed, 'asc' or 'desc' (ascending or descending, respectively).

        Default: 'desc'

        entries_file_name:

        The entries file name format. It is recommended that you do not change this. The file name must include `%Y`, `%m` and `%d` `Time` formatting specifiers to make sure the file name is unique and able to be located by `dsu` functions. For example, the default file name is `%Y-%m-%d.json`; however, something like `%m-%d-%Y.json` or `entry-group-%m-%d-%Y.json` would work as well.

        ATTENTION: Please keep in mind that if you change this value `dsu` will not recognize entry files using a different format. You would (at this time), have to manually rename any existing entry file names to the new format.

        Default: '%Y-%m-%d.json'

        entries_folder:

        This is the folder where `dsu` stores entry files. You may change this to anything you want. `dsu` will create this folder for you, as long as your system's write permissions allow this.

        ATTENTION: Please keep in mind that if you change this value `dsu` will not be able to find entry files in any previous folder. You would (at this time), have to manually mode any existing entry files to this new folder.

        Default: "'#{Dsu::Support::FolderLocations.root_folder}/dsu/entries'"
