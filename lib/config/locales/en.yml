            $ dsu dates OPTIONS

            $ dsu dd OPTIONS

            OPTIONS:

            -a|--include-all true|false: If true, all DSU dates within the specified range will be displayed. If false, DSU dates between the first and last DSU dates that have NO entries will NOT be displayed.. The default is taken from the dsu configuration setting :include_all, see `dsu config info`.

            -f|--from DATE|MNEMONIC: The DATE or MNEUMONIC that represents the start of the range of DSU dates to display. If a relative mneumonic is used (+/-n, e.g +1, -1, etc.), the date calculated will be relative to the current date (e.g. `<MNEUMONIC>.to_i.days.from_now(Time.now)`).

            -t|--to DATE|MNEMONIC: The DATE or MNEUMONIC that represents the end of the range of DSU dates to display. If a relative mneumonic is used (+/-n, e.g +1, -1, etc.), the date calculated will be relative to the date that resulting from the `--from` option date calculation.

            %{date_option_description}

            %{mneumonic_option_description}

            EXAMPLES:

            NOTE: All example results are subject to the `--include-all|-a` option.

            NOTE: All examples can substitute their respective short form options (e.g. `-f`, `-t`, etc. for `--from`, `--to`, etc.).

            The below will display the DSU entries for the range of dates from 1/1 to 1/4 for the current year:

            $ dsu list dates --from 1/1 --to +3

            This will display the DSU entries for the range of dates from 1/2 to 1/5 for the year 2022:

            $ dsu list dates --from 1/5/2022 --to -3

            This (assuming "today" is 1/10) will display the DSU entries for the last week 1/10 to 1/3 of the current year:

            $ dsu list dates --from today --to -7

            This (assuming "today" is 5/23) will display the DSU entries for the last week 5/16 to 5/22.
            This example simply illustrates the fact that you can use relative mneumonics for
            both `--from` and `--to` options; this doesn't mean you should do so...

            While you can use relative mneumonics for both `--from` and `--to` options,
            there is always a more intuitive way. The below example basically lists one week
            of DSU entries back 1 week from yesterday's date:

            $ dsu list dates --from -7 --to +6

            The above can be accomplished MUCH easier by simply using the `yesterday` mneumonic...

            This (assuming "today" is 5/23) will display the DSU entries back 1 week from yesterday's date 5/16 to 5/22:

            $ dsu list dates --from yesterday --to -6
        today:
          desc: today|n
          usage: Displays the DSU entries for today
          long_desc: |
            Displays the DSU entries for today.

            $ dsu list today

            $ dsu list n
        tomorrow:
          desc: tomorrow|t
          usage: Displays the DSU entries for tomorrow
          long_desc: |
            Displays the DSU entries for tomorrow.

            $ dsu list tomorrow

            $ dsu list t
        yesterday:
          desc: yesterday|y
          usage: Displays the DSU entries for yesterday
          long_desc: |
            Displays the DSU entries for yesterday.

            $ dsu list yesterday
