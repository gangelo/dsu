        desc: delete
        usage: Deletes the configuration file
        long_desc: |
          Deletes the configuration file.

          EXAMPLES:

          dsu config delete

          NOTES

          Deleting the dsu configuration file will simply cause dsu to use the default configuration options (`Dsu::Models::Configuration::DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION`).
      info:
        desc: info
        usage: Displays information about this gem configuration
        long_desc: |
          Displays information about this gem configuration.

          EXAMPLES:

          $ dsu config info
      init:
        desc: init
        usage: Creates and initializes a .dsu file in your home folder
        long_desc: |
          Creates and initializes a .dsu file in your home folder (%{home_folder}) that may be edited.

          EXAMPLES:

          $ dsu config init

          CONFIGURATION FILE ENTRIES

          The following configuration file options are available:

          version:

          The configuration version - DO NOT ALTER THIS VALUE!

          editor:

          The default editor to use when editing entry groups if the EDITOR environment variable on your system is not set. The default is 'nano'. You'll need to change the default editor on Windows systems.

          Default: "nano" on nix sytems.

          entries_display_order:

          The order by which entries will be displayed, "asc" or "desc" (ascending or descending, respectively).

          Default: "desc"

          carry_over_entries_to_today:

          Applicable to the `dsu edit` command. Valid values are true|false. If true, when editing DSU entries for the first time on any given day (e.g. `dsu edit today`), DSU entries from the previous day will be copied into the current editing session. If there are no DSU entries from the previous day, dsu will search backwards up to 7 days to find a DSU date that has entries to copy. If after searching back 7 days, no DSU entries are found, the editor session will simply provide no previous DSU entries.

          Default: false

          include_all:

          Applicable to dsu commands that display DSU date lists (e.g. `dsu list` commands). Valid values are true|false. If true, all DSU dates within the specified range will be displayed, regardless of whether or not a particular date has entries. If false, only DSU dates between the first and last DSU dates that have entries will be displayed.

          Default: false

          theme_name:

          Default: "default"
    delete:
      date:
        desc: date|d DATE|MNEMONIC
        usage: Deletes the DSU entries for the given DATE or MNEMONIC
        long_desc: |
          Deletes the DSU entries for the given DATE or MNEMONIC.

          %{date_option_description}

          %{mnemonic_option_description}
      dates:
        desc: dates|dd OPTIONS
        usage: Deletes the DSU entries for the OPTIONS provided
        long_desc: |
          Deletes the DSU entries for the given OPTIONS.

          $ dsu dates OPTIONS

          $ dsu dd OPTIONS

          OPTIONS:

          -f|--from DATE|MNEMONIC: The DATE or MNEMONIC that represents the start of the range of DSU dates to delete. If a relative mnemonic is used (+/-n, e.g +1, -1, etc.), the date calculated will be relative to the current date (e.g. `<MNEMONIC>.to_i.days.from_now(Time.now)`).

          -t|--to DATE|MNEMONIC: The DATE or MNEMONIC that represents the end of the range of DSU dates to delete. If a relative mnemonic is used (+/-n, e.g +1, -1, etc.), the date calculated will be relative to the date that resulting from the `--from` option date calculation.

          %{date_option_description}

          %{mnemonic_option_description}

          EXAMPLES:

          NOTE: All examples can substitute their respective short form options (e.g. `-f`, `-t`, etc. for `--from`, `--to`, etc.).

          The below will delete the DSU entries for the range of dates from 1/1 to 1/4 for the current year:

          $ dsu delete dates --from 1/1 --to +3

          This will delete the DSU entries for the range of dates from 1/2 to 1/5 for the year 2022:

          $ dsu delete dates --from 1/5/2022 --to -3

          This (assuming "today" is 1/10) will delete the DSU entries for the last week 1/10 to 1/3 of the current year:

          $ dsu delete dates --from today --to -7

          This (assuming "today" is 5/23) will delete the DSU entries for the last week 5/16 to 5/22.
          This example simply illustrates the fact that you can use relative mnemonics for
          both `--from` and `--to` options; this doesn't mean you should do so...

          While you can use relative mnemonics for both `--from` and `--to` options,
          there is always a more intuitive way. The below example basically deletes one week of DSU entries back 1 week from yesterday's date:

          $ dsu delete dates --from -7 --to +6

          The above can be accomplished MUCH easier by simply using the `yesterday` mnemonic...

          This (assuming "today" is 5/23) will delete the DSU entries back 1 week from yesterday's date 5/16 to 5/22:

          $ dsu delete dates --from yesterday --to -6
