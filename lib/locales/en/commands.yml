    date_option_description: |
      DATE

      This may be any date string that can be parsed using `Time.parse`.
      Consequently, you may use also use '/' as date separators,
      as well as omit the year if the date you want to display is the
      current year (e.g. <month>/<day>, or 1/31). For example: `require 'time';
      Time.parse('01/02/2023'); Time.parse('1/2') # etc.`
    mneumonic_option_description: |
      MNEUMONIC

      This may be any of the following: n|today|t|tomorrow|y|yesterday|+n|-n.

      Where n, t, y are aliases for today, tomorrow, and yesterday, respectively.

      Where +n, -n are relative date mneumonics (RDNs). Generally speaking,
      RDNs are relative to the current date. For example, a RDN of +1 would be
      equal to `Time.now + 1.day` (tomorrow), and a RDN of -1 would be equal to
      `Time.now - 1.day` (yesterday).

      In some cases the behavior RDNs have on some commands are context dependent;
      in such cases the behavior will be noted.
